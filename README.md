## Growth Mindset
There is no growth without resistance. A **growth mindset** to me is about being able to take challanges head on and being able to learn from the outcome whether you win or lose.

### Reminders
* Never stop learning.
* Patience is key.
* “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty..." ― _Theodore Roosevelt_
