## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

  - Doesn't cause any observable side effects
4. What is immutability?
  - Data whose state cannot be changed after it is created

  - A function that yields the same result for the same input

# Node JS

1. What is a module?
  - a javascript file that contains code with a certain functionality in the application and can be called upon when needed
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
  - allows us to use a function elsewhere in application 
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
  - require(`./moduleName`)
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
  - `module.exports = moduleName;`
