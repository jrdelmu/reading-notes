# Structure web pages with HTML assignment

## What is a wireframe?

Wireframing is essentially architecture but instead of planning and designing building you're planning and designing a website! Before a webpage built and cluttered with colors, images, and videos a wireframe is layed out in plain black and white to allow you to more easily determine and plan where you need all the information to go.

### Steps to making a wireframe

Research is essential when developing a wireframe because there are various forms of data that need to be taken into consideration when developing a website. Knowing such information like the target audience would probably play a key role in how the website would be developed.

### Making a good wireframe

- the wireframe should be clear and concise and convey to the user what kind of site the page is going to be.
- the site should be seamless and easy to navigate in order to inspire condfidence in the user.
- Less is more. The wireframe should be simple with very few distractions.
