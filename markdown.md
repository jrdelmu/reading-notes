# Learning Markdown Assignment

## What is Markdown?
Like Microsoft Word, GitHub also allows you to stylize text, create lists and tables, and much more. The difference is it must be done through the syntax that is **Markdown** rather than simply clicking a button.

## Examples
### Headers
The **number sign** (#) will create a header and the size will be determined by the amount of number signs attached to the header text. A maximum of 6 number signs can be attached to header.
### Text styling
Markdown |	Preview
-------- | -------
`**bold**` |	bold
`_italics_`	| italics
### Tables
The table above is comprised of markdown as well:

`Markdown | Preview`  
`-------- | -------`  
`**bold** | **bold**`  
`_italics_ | _italics_`  
### Lists
Lists can be organized by **ordered** (1.) or **unordered**(*)

#### Unordered
* Grocery List
  * Bacon
  * eggs

#### Ordered
1. Riding a Skateboard
    1. Kick
    1. Push

#### Unordered
