# CSS Layout

[Main Page](https://jrdelmu.github.io/reading-notes/)

CSS identifies each HTML element as having their own box and this box could be either a block or inline element.

- **Block-level** elements will take up an entire row of a page while **inline elements** will only take up as much space is needed for its content.
- Block level elements can be nested inside of each other. The outer box will be the **containing element**.
- Controlling the position of elements
  - normal flow: Default positioning. Block level elements sit on top of the next one. 
  - relative positioning: moves the element in relation to where it originated from its normal flow.
  - absolute positioning:Taken out of normal flow and does not affect surrounding elements.
  - fixed positioning: Fixes the element to the page so that when a user scrolls the element will follow. 
  - floating elements
- It is important to take into consideration the size of a screen when creating and designing. 
- **Fixed width** layouts are static and do not change in size as the user adjusts their window.
- **Liquid layout** are the opposite of fixed layouts and will adjust accordingly to the size of the window.
