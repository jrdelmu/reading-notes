**JavaScript** is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript spec. Together with HTML and CSS, JavaScript allows you to enhance static websites with much more complex features such as graphics and animations. 

## JavaScript Basics

- The `<script>INSERT CODE HERE</script>` tag is inserted into an HTML sheet in order to apply JavaScript code.

- **Variables** are containers for variables like integers and strings. You can establish variables using **var**, **let**, and **const**.
    - Example: `let dogName = 'Jack'`

- **Numbers and Operators**
    - Types of numbers:
        - Integers: Whole numbers
        - Floats: Numbers with decimal points
        - Doubles: A floating number with greater precision 
    - Number Systems:
        - Binary
        - Octal
        - Hexadecimal
    - Arithmetic operators:
        - +: Addition
        - -: Subtraction
        - *: Multiplication
        - /: Division
        - %: Remainder
        - **: Exponent 
- **Strings in JavaScript**
    - **Strings** are a primitive type. THey represent text, and must be wrapped in either single quotes (`'STRING'`) or double quotes (`"STRING"`).
